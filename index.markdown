Welcome to THE Scrolls of Ancient Knowledge! THE Scrolls of Ancient Knowledge contain designs, tutorials, calculations, and other forms of various knowledge accumulated by THE Robotics since 2013. 

Until this site, much of the experience of THE was preserved only through the collective memories of senior members of the team. Now, team members and coaches can contribute information on designs we've tried, programs we've written, and more.
