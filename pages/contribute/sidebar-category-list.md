Some of the folders in the sidebar need to be added to easily by users. These are usually designed as "dynamic folders", which means that you can add a page to the folder just by putting a particular category in the header of the page. This prevents multiple users modifying the sidebar from stepping on each other's toes and makes the contribution process easier for beginners.

Currently there are no dynamic sidebar folders. Please update this as they are added.
