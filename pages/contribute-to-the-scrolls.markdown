THE Scrolls are supposed to retain all of the knowledge acquired by THE over the years, and is therefore constantly in need of new authors to update the site with the newest information. Here is how to contribute to THE Scrolls and become a master of ancient knowledge: 

1. Create a Github account
2. Get access to the repository
3. Set up Jekyll and Git
4. Clone the repository
5. Make and preview changes
6. Publish your changes

## Step 1: Create a Github account
This is the easiest step of all of them. Head over to [github.com](https://github.com) and create an account. It's free and only takes a few minutes. 

## Step 2: Get access to the repository
Now, you need to email us at [robotics@texomahomeeducators.org](mailto:robotics@texomahomeeducators.org) to get access. You should receive an email from Github prompting you to accept the invitation to contribute. It can take a few minutes from the time the invite is sent for the email from Github to arrive, so be patient.
